## 8.2 Realms

Before it is evaluated, all ECMAScript code must be associated with a realm. Conceptually, a realm consists of a set of intrinsic objects, an ECMAScript global environment, all of the ECMAScript code that is loaded within the scope of that global environment, and other associated state and resources.

A realm is represented in this specification as a Realm Record with the fields specified in Table 20:

![table20](../images/table_20png)

NOTE
Once a Parse Node becomes unreachable, the corresponding [[Array]] is also unreachable, and it would be unobservable if an implementation removed the pair from the [[TemplateMap]] list.
[[HostDefined]] Any, default value is undefined. Field reserved for use by host environments that need to associate additional information with a Realm Record.

### 8.2.1 CreateRealm ( )

The abstract operation CreateRealm with no arguments performs the following steps:

1. Let realmRec be a new Realm Record.
2. Perform CreateIntrinsics(realmRec).
3. Set realmRec.[[GlobalObject]] to undefined.
4. Set realmRec.[[GlobalEnv]] to undefined.
5. Set realmRec.[[TemplateMap]] to a new empty List.
6. Return realmRec.

### 8.2.2 CreateIntrinsics ( realmRec )

The abstract operation CreateIntrinsics with argument realmRec performs the following steps:

1. Let intrinsics be a new Record.
2. Set realmRec.[[Intrinsics]] to intrinsics.
3. Let objProto be ObjectCreate(null).
4. Set intrinsics.[[%Object.prototype%]] to objProto.
5. Let throwerSteps be the algorithm steps specified in 9.2.9.1 for the %ThrowTypeError% function.
6. Let thrower be ! CreateBuiltinFunction(throwerSteps, « », realmRec, null).
7. Set intrinsics.[[%ThrowTypeError%]] to thrower.
8. Let noSteps be an empty sequence of algorithm steps.
9. Let funcProto be ! CreateBuiltinFunction(noSteps, « », realmRec, objProto).
10. Set intrinsics.[[%Function.prototype%]] to funcProto.
11. Call thrower.[[SetPrototypeOf]](funcProto).
12. Perform AddRestrictedFunctionProperties(funcProto, realmRec).
13. Set fields of intrinsics with the values listed in Table 7 that have not already been handled above. The field names are the names listed in column one of the table. The value of each field is a new object value fully and recursively populated with property values as defined by the specification of each object in clauses 18-26. All object property values are newly created object values. All values that are built-in function objects are created by performing CreateBuiltinFunction(<steps>, <slots>, realmRec, <prototype>) where <steps> is the definition of that function provided by this specification, <slots> is a list of the names, if any, of the function's specified internal slots, and <prototype> is the specified value of the function's [[Prototype]] internal slot. The creation of the intrinsics and their properties must be ordered to avoid any dependencies upon objects that have not yet been created.
14. Return intrinsics.

## 8.2.3 SetRealmGlobalObject(realmRec,globalObj,thisValue)

The abstract operation SetRealmGlobalObject with arguments realmRec, globalObj, and thisValue performs the following steps:

1. If globalObj is undefined, then
   1. Let intrinsics be realmRec.[[Intrinsics]].
   2. Set globalObj to ObjectCreate(intrinsics.[[%Object.prototype%]]).
2. Assert: Type(globalObj) is Object.
3. If thisValue is undefined, set thisValue to globalObj.
4. Set realmRec.[[GlobalObject]] to globalObj.
5. Let newGlobalEnv be NewGlobalEnvironment(globalObj, thisValue).
6. Set realmRec.[[GlobalEnv]] to newGlobalEnv.
7. Return realmRec.

### 8.2.4 SetDefaultGlobalBindings ( realmRec )

The abstract operation SetDefaultGlobalBindings with argument realmRec performs the following steps:

1. Let global be realmRec.[[GlobalObject]].
2. For each property of the Global Object specified in clause 18, do
   1. Let name be the String value of the property name.
   2. Let desc be the fully populated data property descriptor for the property containing the specified attributes for the property. For properties listed in 18.2, 18.3, or 18.4 the value of the [[Value]] attribute is the corresponding intrinsic object from realmRec.
   3. Perform ? DefinePropertyOrThrow(global, name, desc).
3. Return global.
